<h2><b>Description:</b></h2>
Everyone has three 30 minute sleep cycles, starting with light sleep, then deep sleep, then REM sleep. These three cycles repeat throughout the night until you wake up. It is optimal to wake up during the light sleep so you don't feel groggy or extremely tired when your alarm goes off. This web application will help you plan when you should set your alarm to guarantee that you wake up during light sleep (the most optimal sleeping phase to wake up in). This will result in easier wake ups and more enjoyable mornings.
